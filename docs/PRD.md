### 3.2 Scene Display Components

Each scene contains these elements:

**Visual Layer:**

- Five manga panels in responsive grid layout
- High contrast black and white artwork
- Consistent art style across panels

**Narrative Layer:**
- Scene number and progress indicator at top
- Narrative text (150-250 words)
- Dialogue blocks with character attribution
- Clear typography optimized for reading

**Interactive Layer:**
- Question prompt contextualizing the decision
- Three preset choice buttons with clear action text

### 3.3 User Input Flexibility

**Design Philosophy:**
All user inputs are treated identically by the backend as plain text strings.

**Input Methods:**

**Preset Choices (Buttons 1-3):**
- Displayed as prominent, clickable buttons
- Text formatted as natural language actions
- Examples:
  - "Confront your partner about their deception"
  - "Investigate the supernatural connection alone"
  - "Trust your partner and share what you've discovered"

**Custom Input (Option 4):**
- Text field below preset choices
- Placeholder: "Or type your own response..."
- Character limit: Reasonable length (e.g., 200 characters)
- Submit button: "Submit Custom Response"
- Examples users might type:
  - "I use my psychic powers to read my partner's emotions"
  - "I call for backup before making any decisions"
  - "I walk away and quit the force entirely"

**Backend Processing:**
- Both preset and custom inputs received as plain text
- No special parsing or handling required
- Storyteller Agent incorporates text naturally into next scene
- Examples of incorporation:
  - User input: "Confront your partner" → Scene starts: "You didn't hesitate. The door slammed open before they could react..."
  - User input: "I use my powers to sense danger" → Scene starts: "The moment you opened your mind, visions flooded your consciousness..."

### 3.4 Decision Impact Visibility

**Immediate Feedback:**
- Next scene begins with acknowledgment of user's choice
- Narrative explicitly references the decision made
- Consequences become apparent through story development

**Long-term Tracking:**
- Decision history visible in sidebar
- Manager Agent adjusts story direction based on accumulated choices
- Final scene references at least two previous decisions
- Ending tone reflects overall decision pattern

**Example Impact Chain:**
- Scene 2: User chooses to "trust partner"
- Scene 3: Partner shares critical information
- Scene 5: Partnership proves valuable in crisis
- Scene 7: Ending emphasizes teamwork and trust themes

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 High-Level Architecture

**Two-Workflow Design Philosophy:**

The system separates narrative logic from visual generation, allowing:
- Independent scaling of text vs image generation
- Parallel optimization of different AI tasks
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Modular component replacement

**Workflow Interaction Pattern:**
```
User → Streamlit Frontend
         ↓
Planning Workflow (n8n)
  - Manager Agent
  - Character Agent  
  - Storyteller Agent
         ↓
[Structured Data Package]
         ↓
Image Workflow (n8n)
  - Prompt Generators
  - Image Generation (5x parallel)
         ↓
[Array of Image URLs]
         ↓
Planning Workflow (combines)
         ↓
Streamlit Frontend → User
```

### 4.2 Workflow 1: Planning Workflow (Narrative Generation)

**Purpose:** Generate all story logic, text content, and visual descriptions

**Components:**
- Manager Agent (narrative director)
- Character Agent (character creator)
- Storyteller Agent (scene writer)
- Session state management
- HTTP communication with Image Workflow

**Input:** User prompt, character description, user choices
**Output:** Complete scene package with narrative, dialogue, visual descriptions, choices

**Execution Pattern:**
1. One-time initialization (Manager + Character)
2. Iterative scene generation (Manager → Storyteller → Image Workflow)
3. Loop until story concludes (7-10 iterations)

### 4.3 Workflow 2: Image Sub-Scene Workflow (Visual Generation)

**Purpose:** Transform scene descriptions into manga panel images

**Components:**
- Input parser (structures data for parallel processing)
- Prompt Generator Agent (creates Stable Diffusion prompts)
- Image Generation API caller (Banana/Replicate)
- Result aggregator (combines five panels)
- Response formatter

**Input:** Structured scene data with five sub-scene descriptions
**Output:** Array of five manga panel image URLs

**Execution Pattern:**
1. Receive scene data package via webhook
2. Parse into five sub-scene objects
3. Process all five panels in parallel
4. Aggregate results and return ordered array

### 4.4 Data Flow Architecture

**Session Initialization Flow:**
```
User Input (theme + character)
  → Planning Workflow webhook
  → Manager Agent creates framework
  → Character Agent creates profile
  → Store session state
  → Return to Streamlit: "Ready for Scene 1"
```

**Scene Generation Flow:**
```
User Choice (text string)
  → Planning Workflow webhook
  → Load session state
  → Manager Agent generates scene intent
  → Storyteller Agent creates scene script + 5 visual descriptions
  → HTTP request to Image Workflow
  → Image Workflow returns 5 panel URLs
  → Planning Workflow combines narrative + images
  → Update session state
  → Return to Streamlit: Complete scene
```

**Parallel Image Generation Flow:**
